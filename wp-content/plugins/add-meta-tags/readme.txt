A Free yet feature rich metadata plugin that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content.

== Description ==

_Add-Meta-Tags_ is a Free metadata plugin for the _WordPress Publishing Platform_ that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing of your content by search engines and easier sharing on social networks. It achieves this by generating machine friendly information about your content, called <em>metadata</em>, according to widely used standard specifications.

<blockquote>

Please note that since version 2.11.0 the developer does not provide support for this plugin on any support channel.

<br /><br />

</blockquote>

More specifically, _Add-Meta-Tags_ can generate the _description_ and _keywords_ meta tags, _Opengraph_, _Schema.org_ microdata and JSON+LD data, _Twitter Cards_ and _Dublin Core_ metadata for your _WordPress_ content and archives, your _WooCommerce_ products and product groups, _BuddyPress_ profiles, and more.

It also supports advanced _title customization_ letting you take control of the title generation on every part of the web site. Moreover, a basic _breadcrumb trail_ generator is provided for use with hierarchical post types. Last, but not least, it lets you customize the _locale_ on a per post basis generating a proper `hreflang` link for a signle language and, also, is out-of-the-box compatible with _WPML_ and _Polylang_ multilingual plugins (through the WPML language configuration file that ships with the plugin). Finally, support for [Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://www.ampproject.org/) as generated by the _AMP_ plugin has been implemented.

Add-Meta-Tags supports internal caching of the generated metadata of content and media pages and thus contributes to the preservation of system resources on high traffic web sites. Metadata caching can also lead to slightly faster page load times in several cases.

Add-Meta-Tags was started in 2006. Please visit the [Add-Meta-Tags historical homepage](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/).

= Changelog Entries =

Please check out the changelog of each release by following the links below. You can also check the [roadmap](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/roadmap "Add-Meta-Tags Roadmap") regarding future releases of the plugin.

- 2.11.1
 - Minor fix with the release tags.
- 2.11.0
 - **IMPORTANT**: ALWAYS download the plugin from _WordPress.org_.
 - **NOTICE**: Due to some weird incidents that took place during the last days, I decided to no longer provide support for _Add-Meta-Tags_ on any support channel (issue trackers, WordPress.org forums, email or social media). This is because I can no longer find the required time to distinguish genuine support requests from support requests that simply aim at wasting my time (even on my Paypal address). Apologies to any users who currently have open tickets, but there is nothing more I can do for you. The decision is final. I tried to create a free and useful metadata tool for all, but it turns out it's not a sustainable plan in terms of required time. Moreover, no new feature or improvement of the current features has been planned for the future. The plugin will only receive updates for critical issues like PHP errors. **If you disagree with any of the above, I can only recommend to use other plugins.** Last, but not least, I won't reply to any emails about the plugin.
 - The translations directory has been renamed to `translations-contrib`. Please upload your translations to the translations service provided by WordPress.org, so as to take advantage of the language packs.
 - This release contains no improvements or fixes.
- [2.10.12](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/350)
 - Added keys to items of the metadata array for easier isolation of most of the Opengraph meta tags. (Apologies to Salentomane for not adding this improvement to 2.10.10!)
 - Stopped using deprecated function in the `amt upgrade` subcommand. (Props to Sebastian C. for pointing out the issue!)
 - Minor improvements and fixes of the command line interface.
 - Added template tags for the custom [user](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Template_Tags#User-image) and [term](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Template_Tags#Term-image) image.
 - Added a filter-based switch to override the URL of the user avatar (as returned by the `get_avatar_url()` function) with the URL of the custom user image (as set in the user profile under the _Add-Meta-Tags_ section). For instance, this functionality can make the AMP plugin or any other plugin or theme, which uses the `get_avatar_url()` function to retrieve the user's avatar URL, use the custom user image that is set in Add-Meta-Tags. To enable this functionality use the following: `add_filter('amt_set_user_image_as_avatar', '__return_true');`
 - Added example about how to [customize the main Schema.org entity](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Plugin_Functionality_Customization#Customize-the-main-Schemaorg-entity) depending on the post type. This is also useful for AMP pages which require specific entities.
 - Raised minimum WP requirement to at least 3.6.0. Please note that using the 'custom image' and 'full meta tags' fields on the term edit screen, you need at least 4.4.0.

Changelog information for older releases can be found in the ChangeLog file or at the [roadmap](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/roadmap "Add-Meta-Tags Roadmap") on the [Add-Meta-Tags development web site](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags).

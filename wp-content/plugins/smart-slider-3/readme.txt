== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How do I add the slider to my site? =
You can add your slider by shortcode or via the widget control panel or PHP shortcode.

= 2. Where can I reach the documentation? =
[http://doc.smartslider3.com](http://doc.smartslider3.com)

= 3. What should I do when I see blank area where the slider should show or the slider doesn't work? =
It means that there is a JavaScript error on your site which blocks other scripts(for example Smart Slider's scripts). You can open up the browser debugger window with F12 button and check the console if it shows error or not. If you solve these errors Smart Slider should work fine.

Usual problem is that you have the latest WordPress version, but your theme loads very old jQuery version (1.7 or older) and the WordPress admin bar throws a JavaScript error. In this case, you have to remove the old jQuery from your theme's functions.php.

If you are unable to solve these problems, feel free to [contact us!](http://smartslider3.com/contact-us/)

= 4. What should I do when I experience any problem? =

= 6. Can I customize the fonts of the slider? =
Yes you can customize everything for every state. (hover, active, opened) The slider comes with Google Web Font support, allowing you to pick from over a dozen font families. To make using Google Fonts even easier, we have created a font manager interface that simplifies the process and preview it.

= 7. Can I show multiple instances of slider on one page? =
Yes you can use multiple slider widgets and slider shortcodes.

= 8. How to include a slider in a post or a page? =

### Create a new slider

If you would like to create a new slider then simple go to Smart Slider 3's dashboard and click on the create slider button. When you click on the create slider button a pop up will appear where you will be able to add the name of the slider, the size of the slider and a preset. (Don't worry you can change all slider settings later.) Then you will be taken to the slider settings page where you can configure your slider. There are a lot of settings that are available for configuration. Smart Slider 3 gives you a couple of ways of integrating your slider into your website. The slider page displays the shortcode you should insert into your content area and a sample PHP code to paste in your PHP files. 

### Slider settings

On this page you can find two boxes with multiple tabs in each box. The first settings box has tabs for general, size, and autoplay settings. In general settings tab you can rename your slider and adjust mouse and keyboard controls. Alignment and animation settings can also be modified. In size settings tab you can add exact size of your slider also you can set the responsive mode for the slider. The autoplay tab contains the interval of the autoplay and the stop events for the autoplay. The second settings box responsible for the control elements. It has tabs for arrows, bullets, autoplay, bar, thumbnails and shadows. In this section you can change a lot of styling and positioning of control elements. You have complete control over the control elements, for example: change the image of the arrow, colorize or add style.

### Slider preview

The blue preview button near the top of the page lets you preview your slider on every page. It is useful to do this when customizing your slider as it allows you to see the changes you have made before you integrate a slider into your website. Also you don't have to save for the preview! Just change the slider settings or the slides and press the preview button and if you're satisfied with the result then hit the save button. Of course this function works from the slide editor too.

### Add slides

You can use the default WordPress image manager to select or upload images or simply drag your images to the sidebar section and Smart Slider 3 upload all as new slides for the specified slider. All selected images will be slide background and you will be able to edit the slides if you click on the boxes. But Smart Slider 3 can handle a plenty of resources for example: Youtube video, Vimeo video, post, static and dynamic slides.

### Edit slides

In the slider settings, if you click on a box on the left side then you will be able to edit the slides. You can set the general slide settings on the top for example: name, description, slide background, fill mode, link or background animation. But the best part of the Smart Slider 3 is the brand new canvas which is a fully live interface to create custom designs. On the left side you can select from 6 layers. (image, heading, text, button, Vimeo and Youtube) Just click on the selected layer and you start to build your custom slide. Below the layers you can find the layer list which contains the previously added layers, and below this you can find the actual setting of the layer. The item tab contains the general settings of the layer like the content, font, style or the link settings. The layer tab responsible for the position, size but you can find the settings of the hide on the target device feature too. On the canvas you can simply move the layers with your mouse and the automatic snap help you to align the layers correctly. (Of course you can turn this off anytime above the canvas.) On the right side above the canvas you can switch between the devices and set custom content and design for every device. If you're ready with your slide then don't forget to hit the save button.

### Add sample slider

If you would like to create a new slider form one of the existing sample slider then go to Smart Slider 3's dashboard and click on the add sample slider button. It will pop up a new window where you will be able to download the selected sample slider, this process can take few seconds because the slider has to download the slider package.

1. [Layer slider](http://smartslider3.com/free-layers/) - sample slider included
2. [Full width slider](http://smartslider3.com/free-full-width/) - sample slider included
3. [Thumbnail slider](http://smartslider3.com/free-thumbnail/) - sample slider included
4. [Static image slider](http://smartslider3.com/free-static/) - sample slider included

### Dynamic slides
With the Smart Slider 3 you can create dynamic slides form your post easily. The post's featured image will be the slide background and the title will be the heading layer but you can add new variables to the slider and create your own custom layout for the slider. First of all create a slider then click on the arrow on the add image slide button and choose the create dynamic slides option. On the new page you can choose the dynamic sources for the slider. For post generator you can choose from two methods: Posts by filter and Posts by ID.
Posts by filter: You can choose categories and determine the order sequence. Also add the number of the slides.
Posts by ID: Here you can simple add the post IDs.

After you set the parameters hit the save button and you will be able to create a custom layout for the slider. On the slide page you'll be able to change the design of all slides simultaneously. If you would like to add a new variable then find the green $ button. For example if you hover on the heading's text parameter then you can click on it. It will pop up a new window where you can select from the 16 variables and customize them. Let's see a simple example for usage: Add a button layer, and find the button layer's link parameter and click on the green $ button. Select the URL in the popup window and click on the insert button. Okay now you have a button which has a dynamic contents and it will contain the correct URL for every posts on every slide in the slider.

### Static slides
You can add static slides to the slider which can be good if you would like to add a watermark, a logo or any fix layer to your slider. Imagine it like a layer which is above all the other slides. If you click on the arrow on the add image slide button and choose the create static slide option then you can start to add layers. Please note that this option is basically for layers because with a slide background you can hide the slider.

### Import/Export

If you're on a slider settings page then on the top right corner you can find the export button with this you will be able to download the actual slider. It can be useful as a backup or simply for migration. If you have an exported slider then you can import it from the Smart Slider 3's dashboard.
 
### Help

Support is built directly into the Smart Slider 3 plugin. A blue icon with a lifebelt symbol inside it floats at the bottom right of the page. Clicking on the icon will bring up an FAQ pop up window that allows you to search for answers to solutions. You can also contact with us directly from this box.

### Tips and tricks

* Feel free to re-position the layers on the different devices or if you have a lot of contents then simply hide the unnecessary layers. 
* Above the canvas you can find the adaptive sizing button (it's a double A icon) and the text size modifier settings. If you feel that you font is to small then simple set it bigger on the target device.
* You can move the active layer with the arrow buttons, also if you press the Shift+arrow then the slider move 10 px to the target direction.
* You can set the align of the layer with the numeric buttons too. For example if you hit the 3 button then the layer will be aligned vertically top and horizontally left.
* With the Del button you can delete the layer.
* If you drag images to the canvas then the slider upload all images as a new layers. It works also if you drag the images to the slides sidebar then the slider upload the images as new slides.
